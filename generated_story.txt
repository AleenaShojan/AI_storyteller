Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a kingdom ruled by a wise king.

The king of kings, he said, was the one who had been born into the world, and who came to live with his people. The king said to him, "You have done good, my lord."
, The King of Kings said unto him. "I have not," said the king, because I am not the son of my father, but I have been given to you. But this man, who was born of a man of no great power, came, with a great deal of riches, to take my mother's life. He took her and gave her up, as a ransom for his life, even as he gave up his own life for the sake of his father. And the child was taken from him by his master, the King. Now, for what is his worth? A son's worth is to be taken, if he will not give up the life he has taken. A life that is worth nothing, a life worth no more than a death, is a loss to the kingdom of God, which is nothing. That is why the man who is born with the riches of the land is taken by the evil king who has given up everything for a sake that he can no longer live, that the only thing that can be done for him is that which he must do to make him worthy of life and power. This is the reason why we have so many kings. They are the ones who have taken away the lives of their own children, those who gave them up to their masters, their fathers, or their parents, they who are in the midst of an army, of war, warring with one another, fighting against one other, waging war against another. Those are all the kings of this world. Therefore, I say to thee, thou hast done right. Let not thy children be sold for gold and silver, nor have any of them be put to death for their sins. For thou art the Lord of all things. Thou hast taken their lives, not for any other reason than to do good. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
